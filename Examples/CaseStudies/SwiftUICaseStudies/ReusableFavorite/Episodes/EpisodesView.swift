  This screen demonstrates how one can create reusable components in the Composable Architecture.

  It introduces the domain, logic, and view around "favoriting" something, which is considerably \
  complex.

  A feature can give itself the ability to "favorite" part of its state by embedding the domain of \
  favoriting, using the `Favoriting` reducer, and passing an appropriately scoped store to \
  `FavoriteButton`.

  Tapping the favorite button on a row will instantly reflect in the UI and fire off an effect to \
  do any necessary work, like writing to a database or making an API request. We have simulated a \
  request that takes 1 second to run and may fail 25% of the time. Failures result in rolling back \
  favorite state and rendering an alert.
